# Hill-and-Valley-Prediction

# Objective
To develop an ML Model to predict whether the given datapoints are of a Hill or Valley using Logistic Regression Method

# Data Source
This dataset was taken from the GitHub repository maintained by the YBI Foundation.. Each record represents 100 points on a two dimensional graph. When plotted in order (from 1 through 100) as the Y coordinate, the point will create either a Hill (a "bump") or a Valley (a "Dip").

1-100 Labeled "Vaa Floating point values (numeric), the X-values

101: Labeled "Class". Binary (0, 1) representing (valley, hill)
